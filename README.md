# dit-assignment2# CA2cloudcomputing


I completed Part 1-1,2 and Part 2-1.
I failed to complete Part 2-2 and Part 3.

At part 1-1, refering lab sheet at 6 week, I made docker swarm.
At part 1-2, refering Basel's git hub, I implemented codes.
You can see detail of this task at youtube(I already submitted it together). 

At part 2-1, I used command like this.
1. docker pull nginx
2. docker service create --replicas 5 -p 80:80 --name web nginx
3. docker service ps web


my external IP is 35.195.217.205.
